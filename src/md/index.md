# PlotDB Dev Guide

The main goal of PlotDB is to provide an interface between both developers and non-developers to collaborate over a visualization work. In this developer part, you will learn the following:

 * [how to offline render with PlotDB API](/doc/render/)
 * [Create your own reusable visualization](doc/spec/)

## Offline Rendering

With [PlotDB Render API](/doc/render/), You can render and use visualizations in your own website, without the dependency of PlotDB server. Furthermore, you can create a bundle of selected visualization and make them a customized library from existing visualization works.

* [PlotDB Render API Documentation](/doc/render/)

## Create New Visualization

Despite the fact that PlotDB already provides lots of visualization, you may still want to create your own visualization. To make visualization reusable and have the ability to offline rendering, you need to follow the [PlotDB Visualization Specification](/doc/spec/).
